# hardhat-walkthrough

This is my completed walkthrough of the [Hardhat project setup tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/). 

If you're unfamiliar, Hardhat is a development environment tool for Ethereum. 

I plan to use it to refer to future projects that have a use case for Hardhat.

This project also uses [Waffle](https://github.com/EthWorks/Waffle), a testing library for Ethereum code and [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), a compact yet robust library for interacting with Ethereum from... a Javascript web project? I can only assume?
